        <p>
            Ho, ho, ho! It's Christmas time, and Santa needs your help to make the town sparkle with holiday joy! 
            Oh no, Dasher and friends got a bit carried away in the Holly Jolly Maze, and all the baubles for the Christmas tree were scattered! <br>
            Your mission is to venture through the maze and gather up all those shiny baubles. The town's Christmas Spirit depends on you! 
            But wait, the tree won't be complete without its crowning glory â€“ the shimmering star!<br>
            Quick, little helper! There's not a moment to spare. Can you find all the baubles and unlock the star to bring Christmas cheer to all the boys and girls in town? 
            Time is ticking, so get ready for a festive adventure! Good luck and jingle all the way! ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„
